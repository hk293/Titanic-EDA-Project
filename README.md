# Titanic Dataset - EDA Project

## Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to find patterns related to passenger survival.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Followed
1. Imported necessary libraries.
2. Loaded the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`).
3. Performed basic exploration using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and checked for missing values.
4. Conducted univariate analysis using countplots and histograms.
5. Conducted bivariate analysis like survival vs gender and class.
6. Built a correlation heatmap and a pairplot for deeper understanding.

## Observations
- Women had a higher survival rate.
- First-class passengers had a better chance of survival.
- Fare and class were important factors affecting survival.
- Age and Cabin had missing values that might need cleaning in further analysis.

## Note
Make sure `train.csv` is available in the same folder before running the notebook.
